For writing programs I make sure that they are easy to read and follow along. When writing code you are usually making the code for other people to look through and use or make changes so it is important that the code can be organized into each of its sections and be able to be broken down. The practice of making a Python CRUD is very beneficial for testing the fundamental functions of a database and and this that I made can be implemented on any future projects when working with a database. From the perspective of a computer science it was important to understand what the clients requests were and be able to implement them into the product as well as making said product functional for the user. For this project in particular the requests were already laid out so the focus was on building what these requests were. Computer scientist craft software for the use of its clients as well as make the software functional and easy to navigate should a problem arise. To help a company like Grazioso Salvare for example I am able to understand what their requests are and implement the software to accomodate them. With this work specifically I learned how to work on and create a database with existing information. A company in the future may request that I implement their data into a new database for them to use and this experience can help me accomplish that goal.
